        <head>Prologue, spoken by <name>Mr. Hart</name>
        </head>
        <l>Poets like Cudgel'd Bullys, never do</l>
        <l>At first, or second blow, submit to you;</l>
        <l>But will provoke you still, and ne're have done,</l>
        <l>Till you are weary first, with laying on:</l>
        <l>We patiently you see, give up to you,</l>
        <l>Our Poets, Virgins, nay our Matrons too.</l>
